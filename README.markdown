# Notes

- I am using mostly standard dep definitions (not the other special dep types) because I want full awareness and control of what is being run. I also want the dep definition to easily read as a set of instructions for how to do the setup manually. Starting with this format, it should be easy enough to add in custom or build-in meta deps and other babushka functionality later where beneficial.
